# Spoti_match In progress

The idea is to have an algorithm that will compare individuals' Spotify streaming history and give a score on how well two people match with each other (Depending on the kinds of music/genres they listen to in common).

- Currently, the app can make proper api requests to gather users' history of streaming using Spotify api and users' credentials.
